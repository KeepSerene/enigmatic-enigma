### Overview

- Developed a fully functional Enigma machine simulator in Python using the Pygame library, adhering to object-oriented programming principles with classes across multiple files. The simulator visually represents the machine's components, including the rotors, plugboard, reflector, keys, and lamps, offering an interactive experience of the encryption process.

- Integrated historical Enigma rotor settings, customizable rotor positions, and plugboard configurations. Users can input letters and observe real-time encryption, including the option to adjust rotor turnover notches, closely mimicking the behavior of the original Enigma machine.
